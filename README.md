Sure, I can help you create a README for a GitHub project based on the collaborative filtering recommender system exercise. Here's a sample README template you can use and modify according to your project's specifics:

Collaborative Filtering Recommender System
This project implements a collaborative filtering learning algorithm to build a recommender system for movies. It utilizes collaborative filtering to suggest movies to users based on their previous ratings and the ratings of other users with similar tastes.

Overview
The collaborative filtering algorithm predicts movie ratings for users by learning feature vectors for both users and movies. The dot product of a user's feature vector and a movie's feature vector, plus a bias term, estimates the rating a user might give to a movie.

This project is an exercise from a machine learning course, adapted and extended to demonstrate the practical application of collaborative filtering in a recommender system.

Dataset
The dataset used is derived from the MovieLens "ml-latest-small" dataset, which has been reduced in size to focus on movies from the years since 2000. The reduced dataset consists of ratings on a scale of 0.5 to 5 in 0.5 step increments, with n_u = 443 users, and n_m = 4778 movies.

Implementation Details
Notation and Data Structures: The implementation uses matrices to store user ratings (Y), whether a user has rated a movie (R), movie features (X), user features (W), and user biases (b).

Collaborative Filtering Learning Algorithm: The algorithm learns the parameters for collaborative filtering, i.e., the feature vectors for users and movies, by minimizing the squared error between the predicted ratings and the actual ratings.

Cost Function: The cost function includes a regularization term to prevent overfitting, ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Optimization: A TensorFlow custom training loop with the Adam optimizer is used to learn the model parameters.

Recommendations: After training, the model can predict ratings for movies that a user has not yet rated. These predictions are used to recommend movies to the user.

Getting Started
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your machine along with the following packages:

NumPy
TensorFlow
Pandas
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Run the Jupyter notebook to train the model and generate movie recommendations.

bash
git clone <https://github.com/Qmumu/ml_lab5>
cd collaborative-filtering-recommender
jupyter notebook
Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model and customize your movie ratings for personalized recommendations.
